	see, birds
	they have limited agency
	not much, but
	it&apos;s not worth it to try and mold them into something they don&apos;t wanna beEdited 
	and this bird, in particular
	you can NOT
	NOT

	on a related note, I&apos;ve been on a wiki for IBM ThinkPads for about 90 minutes
	...on another related note, there&apos;s a wiki for IBM ThinkPads
	there&apos;s one on eBay for literally 10 dollars
	i&apos;d get it if the fucker only accepted payment through Moneybookers
	I guess he&apos;s too off-the-grid cool to use paypal
	I get what I need out of what I have
	I&apos;m thinking of buying like 8 pounds of rice and beans and just living in the barn for the winter
	just as a test of minimalist living
	Thoreau was an asshole
	I&apos;m just poor

	I wrote to them
	probably
	it&apos;s so rare to find someone who&apos;s as big a fan of Guess Who as I am
	I asked him if he was richard

	and sent this picture
	Iunno, he&apos;s probably a billionare
	maybe he&apos;ll pay me to spoonfeed him caviar while he&apos;s in a diaper or something
	so like
	if you rent a parking spot
	are you allowed to sleep in it?

	as slavoj zizek would say, you are not eating the potato chip, you are eating the ideology that the potato chip represents 
	you have, how you say, the chip, the crispy texture and the taste, but there is something else there that is the essence of potato chip 
	if you&apos;re introducing random terms to the masses, might I suggest a thing? 
	filmographic 
	when you&apos;re looking at a list of movies Steven Seagal has starred in on Wikipedia and it gives you a massive erection 
	a &quot;filmo&quot;, I suppose, would be just, like, an imdb page or something 
	holy shit, did I just type that? 
	this is fantastic shit 
	see, I thought I was just thinking that 
	I can peel one third of a banana telekenetically 
	the rest is up to god 
	guys, I want to let you in on the ground floor of an amazing business opportunity 
	it&apos;s called DBK Financial 
	I love it, it loves me, and if you let it, it can love you too 
	and it is! 
	he&apos;s been hitting record profits since he started back up 
	I might need to share the wealth via IHOP 
	I agree 
	though we should never actually visit any locations 
	we can have that shit delivered to a Dave and Busters or something 
	which is where we&apos;ll actually eat 
	lol 
	looks like the Best Friends are finally tackling D4 
	god have mercy on their souls 
	4swery65me 
	vote Bored/Dull 201 
	comment from a yahoo article on the McRib:
	This isn&apos;t new, I remember from a recent article stating that Imahara was invited payed by McDonalds to come and visit their facilities. This has a rather uncanny resemblance to how the Nazis invited right groups to their supposed &quot;concentration&quot; camps inhabited by playing children and smiling families.
	also, Nightcrawler&apos;s super good
	Jake Gyllanhal movie
	sociopath turned reporter who specializes in grusome car crashes and whatnot

	^trailer
	lol
	the pirate bay has a 50 minute video on their front page about not talking to the police
	subtle
	Im not watching it, just a video titled &quot;don&apos;t talk to the police&quot;
	excessive jacking off
	I was watching Interstellar...
	long before anyone paid me to watch it...
	I just like how it feels...

	oh, I read that as hug...
	Will Charpentier Episode VII: The Force Awakens
	that would&apos;ve been a tragedy, losing your wallet
	what if you were to ever visit that micronation that has pokemon on its currency?
	yeah, I think so
	whichever one also has Darth Vader on paper money
	http://theorderoftheironphoenix.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Niue-Money.jpg
	It&apos;s a protectorate of New Zealand
	I wanna go there
	I could fight a Palin
	that&apos;d be kinda life affirming
	like hunting a bear
	I think the latest one is a snowmobile
	XD there&apos;s some guy riding it down a mountain
	it just stops halfway through, sends him flying into a tree
	XD
	so, people should see Birdman at some point
	because
	it looks really good
	its Michael Keaton playing a washed up actor who used to play the superhero &quot;Birdman&quot; in the 90&apos;s
	so, it&apos;s Michael Keaton the movie
	I wanna play nightcrawlers with 1/2 brokeback mountain
	cool!
	you could buy half a grilled cheese!
	that actually used to happen a lot at cumby&apos;s
	though, the miss mendon probably used an actual grill for their shit, which is 100 times dumber
	oh yeah, I mean if it was still frozen afterwards, that would&apos;ve been dumber
	oh no!
	aww yes!
	King Kong aint got shit on something something!
	AAAAAAWWWWwwwwwwwwyoooouuuu motherfucka!
	aww
	I&apos;ve only ever seen one Denzel Washington movie
	I remember, it was like 3 years ago, the first time I ever had a white russian
	I don&apos;t lnow what the movie was, but it involved him explaining to his wife how he got an STD or something
	he got chained to a bed and this girl raped him
	Ethan Hawke, why won&apos;t you love hiiiim?
	The Avengers: Rise of Deep Blue Sea?Edited 
	this will be playing at my wedding reception
	yes
	yes I do
	XD that is amazing
	hey man, when&apos;s the last time you smoked weed?
	uhhhhh, like, 12th grade?
	we were uhh
	smoking weed?
	yeah
	XD Ethan Hawke is like my 2nd favorite white guy
	next to Tom Hanks maybe
	XD yeah I could see that
	like, a combination of Dorff and Matthew McConaughey
	also, i feel like it&apos;s impossible to spell McConaughey without looking it up first
	Don&apos;t you mean David Carradine?
	He&apos;s part cherokee Scott
	oh yeah, that reminds me, John Wick&apos;s in theatres too
	yep
	there&apos;s a lot of good movies out right now
	Nightcrawler&apos;s at 7:15 in bellingham
	hey guys what about Ouija?
	So it&apos;s just us fucking with him?
	oh man!
	now that&apos;s a Shaymalan Twist!
	or what if, in interstellar, the planet they find is Wayne Manor?
	yes
	and also, he&apos;s haunted by ghosts of girlfriends past
	nope
	hmm, well, it&apos;s a Boston area code
	a text asking about weed
	that narrows it down to about 7 million people
	THE NUMBERS KK, WHAT DO THEY MEAN?
	He&apos;s my favorite
	I was watching Half Baked the other day, totally forgot he made a cameo
	Good Burger?
	XD both are pretty valid guesses
	allright KK, it&apos;s a verizon number
	well this is interesting
	Hey man, Minecraft just added rabbits and sponges
	also, KK, I&apos;ve narrowed down the number to 6,999,99 
	no no, scott, say it with me
	saaaandbox
	it&apos;s fine
	I agree
	that&apos;s why I love it
	its the laziest thing in the world that&apos;s become successful
	and I respect the shit out of that
	Points!
	and so ends the case of the mysterious druggie
	guys, I think Friends killed my TV
	no remote, power, channel and volume buttons not working
	I unplugged it a couple minutes ago
	I know very little about LoL, but Pro Pain made me laugh 
	watch where ya going, ya foo!
	is any amount of fur in one&apos;s mouth pleasant?
	guys
	Evil Kinevil was in movies
	and it&apos;s amazing
	I love that man
	I like his take on Lance Armstrong
	&quot;Oprah was like, how could you use steroids, I&apos;m so shocked!&quot;
	&quot;Didn&apos;t oprah, like, for the first 5 years, interview midgets who wanted to bang their boyfriends mailman?&quot;
	yeah, that would be awesome
	Honey Boo Boo&apos;s mom gets an hour
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YL04v-J5U
	the second one
	and that all sounds like a heap of garbage franky
	hope things turn out not unspectacularly
	yeah, I see what you mean
	they&apos;re all great, just seems to me the chrome finish is more appropriate
	for me it&apos;s the letter spacing
	ahh, too much
	with that and the rest of the logo, just too much going on
	I see where you&apos;re going with the red by itself though
	you know, the spacing looks fine for chrome for some reason
	maybe it&apos;s just because the red doesn&apos;t git as good with the rest of the logo
	...why do you know a guy who does laserdisc ads?
	is your friend spock?
	oh that&apos;s good
	like, right of an ad from an 80&apos;s comic
	XD

	this belongs on a voyager golden record in the future

	2014: the death of all things good
	Shingeki no Pokemon?
	hype
	Thank you for your journalistic integrity, Jay 
	the people need to know about the Coyotes 
	we could get one of those bear-resistant suits
	would probably translate to coyotes
	I had a really in depth conversation with someone about ikilledabearonce
	they liked them, I convinced them they were horrible
	and then felacio was performed
	lol
	has anyone seen the nickleback vs rooster thing?
	it&apos;s pretty much made up for everything shitty in 201 
	XD
	See
	Elliot Rodger&apos;s hell will be
	he&apos;ll listen to that Nickelback song
	but the line &quot;look at this photograph&quot;
	will be repeated over and over
	and it will be a picture of the devil having intercourse with his mother
	see, the key to getting out of any critcism is to claim that you&apos;re avant guarde
	which is basically artistic bankrupcy
	they have yet to declare avant guarde
	the only time I watched that movie
	man, like, I can&apos;t remember a time when I actually covered my eyes due to graphic shit
	see, I feel as though the movie could&apos;ve been saved
	if when Willem DaFoe came blood
	shouted &quot;I&apos;ll get you one day, Spiderman!&quot;
	Tom Atkins whispering &quot;revengeeee...&quot;
	yes, good
	might I also offer for considerationEdited 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr_nJXAqXqU
	hey, cool!
	you&apos;re nursing a hangover, I&apos;m just beginning to drink!
	it&apos;s the ciiiiiiiircle of liiiiiiiife!
	XD
	what&apos;s been worse
	headache or stomach?
	that&apos;s good
	water realllllllllllly helps during drinking
	what sport?
	fencing I hope
	oh niceness
	yeah, you gotta blend in!
	learn their secrets
	national security depends on it
	so like
	I wanna take a poll here
	how many people, upon first hearing about ISIS
	thought about Archer?
	it kinda makes me sad they&apos;re not covering it
	there&apos;s a lot of comedic potential there
	also, their take on Kim Kardashian is my favorite thing this year
	I love that man
	best villain atop an oil rig ever
	so, Kim Kardashian did a photoshoot with some magazine
	http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/13/1415869107302_wps_5_KIM_KARDASHIAN_BLACK_BAR_.jpg
	this is the cornerstone picture
	the tagline associated with said picture is &quot;break the internet&quot;
	https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/poovey.jpg?w=650&amp;h=83 
	this is Archer&apos;s response
	did I spell &quot;avante garde&quot; wrong?Edited 
	oh well, guess I&apos;m some sort of lowlife plebian
	XD
	who knows!
	it&apos;s a term invented by the french to justify their snootiness
	it&apos;s why John was shot instead of Yoko
	by comparison he was too mainstream
	like
	I&apos;ve been listening to a lot of comedy albums as of late
	and all of them have their own version of a joke about the wrong people in history being shot
	and they all mention Yoko as someone who shoud&apos;ve been
	like, Bill Burr, Bill Hicks, Dennis Leary
	so, there are a shitton of good movies out right now
	we should go see one of them at some point
	like, I was really depressed this summer, because Guardians of the Galaxy was the only one worth watching
	but man, right now, the field&apos;s golden
	yeah, I saw that too
	I imagine that&apos;s just Brandon White in the future
	so, Tom Atkins shoud totally be in the next Halloween remake
	like, they&apos;ve remade Halloween I and II
	Season of the Witch is next XD
	sleep is bullshit 
	it takes away precious time you could be using to watch Death Wish 3 
	Kirk Cameron would have you believe that 
	so upon further investigation, there is in fact a movie called Laserhawk 
	it&apos;s from 1997 
	starring Mark Hamill for some reason 
	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH5s9ksfaLc 
	for the movie Redline? 
	he&apos;s KK, right? so he probably would&apos;ve been in Germany at the time 
	...what? 
	so he&apos;s a notorious adulterer? 
	I thought KK was an arthropod 
	so wait, what the hell&apos;s Aziz Ansari? 
	he does like Kanye 
	whoops, my bad 
	that was Bobby Dias 
	we...we don&apos;t talk about Bobby Dias 
	he is anywhere from being two to infinity terrorists 
	oh yeah, James Avery 
	he was cool 
	hey man 
	we got 
	The Big Bang Theory 
	like, Bazinga, man 
	Sheldon Cooper is to nerds what Steve Urkel was to black people 
	Franky, have you seen Too Many Cooks? 
	I think you would appreciate such a thing 
	in your current state of mind 
	that is literally one step away from making people suits 
	Framingham is a city in the same way that Robin Williams is alive 
	good for you, man! 
	I sorta live in a crawlspace 
	I can get behind that 
	I&apos;ll look you up if I&apos;m homeless and wandering the streets of Framingham

	Gurney, make this a bonus level in your game
	the tight dave thing? 
	I too thought it was a standalone thing 
	&quot;There are only 3 types of people in this world: Gumbel, friends of Gumbel, and fucking TIGHT DAVE!&quot;Edited

	don&apos;t fall into gender stereotypes, Nikki
	have franky iron shit while you play football and eat high-sodium foods!
	ahh, I&apos;ll probably be in grafton until about 8ish?
	my Dad&apos;s getting out of the hospital to attend, so it&apos;s kind of a must show up scenarioEdited 
	like, the fact that I don&apos;t have a car might complicate things, but I&apos;ll make it work
	I have Medway people who owe me things
	also, 50 proof vodka is my new best friend
	because I can drink it more that 160% faster than 80 proof vodka
	ok, ok
	new acquaintance
	we met at a party, exchanged phone numbers
	wouldn&apos;t leave my kids to it in the result of my death
	I should teach you how to make firecrackers
	they&apos;re fast and effective
	if you like edibles, that is
	so, basically what you do
	you grind your product
	you mix it in with a mixture of peanut butter and olive oil
	put all that between graham crackers
	and put it in a toaster oven for about 15 minutes
	a little bit
	in order to activate various thc related properties heat is required, and 15 minutes under 350 degree temperatures is enough
	it&apos;s absorbed into the high-fat peanut butter-olive oil stuff
	I&apos;ve tried it, it works
	just gotta be sure it&apos;s grinded up
	ya want maximum surface area for the thc to be absorbed into food stuffs
	I&apos;m sufficiently drunk
	I&apos;ll offer you a challenge KK
	try to explain that to me in terms you think I&apos;d understand
	yes, bit and byte, I&apos;ve heard these terms before
	is 1/0 not simply a representation of true/false?
	mkay
	this is shit I kinda want to get into
	I have not read foundationEdited 
	statistically speaking, I am nobody
	XD
	apologies
	I can kinda relate to that
	this girl that I was kinda doing stuff with
	who was indirectly responsable for Lou&apos;s demise
	lied about her mother&apos;s involvement with Jim Henson
	or, specifically, her puppetering work in The Muppets Take Manhattan
	like, other than the fact she was seeings someone else
	this was one of the reasons why we aren&apos;t doing stuff anymore
	man, it sucks not being able to go into a certain town...
	under penalty of getting a whoopin
	yes, good
	I want my DNA on the dark crystal
	ahh
	not explicitly
	it&apos;s fine, Franky, it&apos;s just
	I can&apos;t go to Medway for a while
	which is fine
	because who the fuck has heard of Medway
	well, I mean
	I&apos;m kind of at fault, sort of
	well, actually, not really
	she&apos;s at fault, certainlyu
	serves you right for using grass type
	XD
	I&apos;ve got a pretty good team right now for my nuzlocke
	Magmar, Swampert, Heracross, Larvitar, Aerodactyl
	another I can&apos;t remember
	Ursaring
	nah, it can&apos;t, I tried
	not in Gen III at least
	but that&apos;s ok
	I mean, those who aren&apos;t weak to water have decent Special Defenses anyways
	I caught a lvl. 45 celebi, too, so I might use that
	Hey, Franky
	are we nerds?
	I&apos;ve named my pokemon after characters from Titan A.E.
	I&apos;m not sorry
	life is a waterfall, man
	Billy Laverty, that&apos;s a name I&apos;m going to remember
	so, I&apos;m planning on doing more standup in the future
	and I need generic names to make jokes around
	Billy Laverty
	that&apos;s perfect
	sure thing
	I&apos;ve allready used Mark Riendeau
	Scott, there is only one other alternate universe
	and in that universe you&apos;re named Billy Baldwin
	you do become a vampire
	you just wouldn&apos;t exist
	I watched Tower of Terror
	3 times this past Halloween
	and it was AWESOME!
	welp
	Steve Gutenberg the actor hasn&apos;t been photographed since 2003Edited 
	so that may very well be what he looks like
	man, I hate Medway, guys
	it ruined both Tower of Terror and When Good Ghouls go Bad
	just a thing she&apos;s trying out
	I think that&apos;s her favorite homestuck character
	the power to never set foot in Medway?
	that
	was one time
	I was only able to do that
	because a nazi was living in that town
	that nazi is now dead
	as shitty as Medway is
	there are no known nazis living there
	http://www.masslive.com/news/worcester/index.ssf/2013/07/sutton_man_among_suspected_naz.html
	ohmygod, it&apos;s  a pidgey!
	I assume that&apos;s like trying to read english as written by those who only speak mandarin
	so, theoretically speaking, who here would be willing to go to Cumberland, RI to see me do stand-up?
	about a 25 minute drive from Mendon
	just scouting locations
	just messaged the place on facebook
	I think it&apos;d be fun
	it&apos;d also be a lot closer than the last place I did stuff
	I&apos;ll let you guys know
	guys, ReBoot is getting a reboot
	metta is meta
	http://io9.com/keanu-reeves-and-roland-emmerich-are-remaking-the-matri-163257239 
	also, the Matrix (in a way) is getting a reboot as well
	we&apos;ve made it, everyone
	we don&apos;t need to make any more things

	Space Ghost is love
	Space Ghost is lifr
	so
	Brak is sorta relevant again
	he has a programming block on Cartoon Network
	he hosts like
	Dexters Lab
	Ed Edd n Eddy
	a bunch of 90&apos;s cartoon cartoons
	it&apos;s fineeeee
	i mean
	like
	Space Ghost isn&apos;t around to contain him anymore
	it&apos;s just Brak and that praying mantis thing
	which show?
	becuase Ed Edd n Eddy is a fucking institution
	hey
	heyyyyyyy
	squidbillies has a special place in my heart
	when I was 1 
	and very
	veryyyyyyy
	sleep deprived
	I watched squidbillies
	like, that is the appeal of adult swim
	sleep deprivation+budding prebupescence
	=comedy
	oh
	I&apos;m sorry&apos;
	have you evr seen
	FLCL?
	motherfucker?

	HAVE YOUSEEN PERFECT HAIR FOERVER?
	WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???
	I;m watching this online streaming service called Toonami Aftermath
	it&apos;s weird as shit
	watching a rifftrax epsidoe
	franky
	my bfrother
	so, I&apos;ll let you iun on a secret
	he sells weed
	I will steal some
	and I&apos;ll make some edibles for ys to enjoy
	he is going to jail
	but before that
	he is probably gonna have a kid
	this is my one an donly motivation to be succesful
	to raise my nephew as my son
	ht might legitimately have hgad a son allrady
	he&apos;s a compulsivew lier, but like
	iunno
	if I have a relative
	and he doesn&apos;t wanna take care of him/her
	I
	I&apos;ll have to see what I can doEdited 
	my only plan, besides going back to college
	is making it in stand up
	2wich wont happen
	but lilke
	I gotta support chewbacca Kelley
	so
	my dad had a stroke a couple months ago
	his favorite comedian is Jeff Dunham
	so I sorta hafe to liek him now
	iunno
	I don&apos;t hate jeff dunham simp,y becauyse he&apos;s a puppet guy
	I hat ejeff dunham becayue he doeswbnt come up with any new material
	his act is literally &quot;I KILL YOU&quot;
	for five specials
	so Franky
	if I were to come and live with yoy
	like
	I&apos;m planning on buying about $300 worth of rice and beans anyways
	which will feed me for a year
	and as far as electricity si concenrned
	all I need is my laptop
	so liek, Iunno
	oh yeah, I expect that
	I assume that the cost of living in Utah is much less than in Mass
	the thing is
	I have the means to sustain myself for at least a year
	if I were to come out to utah
	so if that were the case, I will do that
	Iunno, let&apos;s keep a dialogue open
	also
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBoot#Revival
	the news is more than a year old
	but there hasn&apos;t been any contradictory news
	Hey Franky, you ever think that this reality&apos;s bullshit?
	that maybe the way thing&apos;s are arent&apos; necessarily the way things should be?Edited 
	like, the fact that you and I exist in the first place
	if not for the holocaust, our parents may never have even met/existed
	I&apos;m asking this, beacuse
	and solely because
	Interetellar
	decent movie
	but dumbest plot point of all time
	I wont&apos; spoil it if you havent seen it but
	no, see, gurney , it&apos;s fine
	becayuse
	accordine to Anne Hathaway
	love
	is something that transcends dimensions
	I agree
	they nailed the 3d properties of black holes
	yeah
	mcconaugey should&apos;ve been spaghetti
	I enjoyed the film for the most part
	I mean
	he wanted to be a farmer
	fuck farmers, man
	they&apos;re not even people
	my biggest complaint
	and like, I did like the movie for the most pary
	was the concept of love transcending shit
	like
	Anne Hathaway
	&quot;oh hey, I have a crush on this guy, but iut isn&apos;t just a crush:
	maybe it&apos; means something
	like on a 5th dimensional level
	and then \
	in the movie, love IS ACTUALLY somethin that transcends dimensions
	like
	fuck
	too drunk to wikipedia that
	gonna assume that thats like
	past information affecting th eufture
	or vice versa
	but actually
	just future humans
	helpes past humans
	I kinda have a beef with how they represented that\
	the way they showed it
	it was multiple sections of what three dimensuonal space would&apos;ve appaeard to a 3 dimensional being
	not a creative representation of a tesserract
	but I guess
	I don&apos;t care
	because the lincoln lawyer was present?
	it seemed
	very
	VERY
	convenient that
	he would fall into a black hole
	and then end up beneath a bookcase
	like, reboot kirk finding old spock in star trek reboot levels of convenience
	sure, you wanna represent 4/5 dimensional space in terms of 3 dimensioms
	fine
	but plot
	fuck&apos;
	so many holes
	this is why
	for better or worse
	Christopher Nolan is the molst prolific director of this generation
	is there any deeper meaning behind his films?
	is he just Michael Bay with more talent?
	that&apos;s up to the filmgoer
	the illusionist was great
	have not seen the prestige
	though
	have tou seen the Dark Knight?
	XD
	it&apos;s certainly his most mainstream film
	though
	I can recommend Heath Ledger&apos;s Joker as one of the best movie villains of all time
	yeah
	history will criticize trhat decision
	though christian bale is not why people will watch tha film
	Nolan is shit when it comes to sheer plot
	he deals in characters
	and when it comes to his Joker
	he nailed it
	like
	Heath Ledger fucking DIED for his role
	that&apos;s something
	so
	he was so involved in his role&apos;
	he was on like 10 separeate medications
	evidently he overdosed
	accidentally
	so
	the character he wa portraying
	was so very violent/grusome
	and Heath Legder wanted to really, utterly get into character
	like Daniel-Day-Lewis Style
	he needed medication to deal witg the cgaracter he was portraying
	and evidently he took too much of the medication he was perscribed
	no, it helped him deal with the depression/anxiety caused by his immersion into the roll
	I guess he took too much
	his dead body was evidetly discovered by one of the olson twins
	I have great respect for Heath Ledger
	not just for his role as the Joker
	A Knight&apos;s Tale is one of my favorite movies
	but like, I reallly don&apos;t like Anne Hathaway&apos;s role in Interstellar
	almost ruined the movie for me
	kinda the Emma of SciFi
	&quot;oh, we love people even after they die&quot;
	&quot;there&apos;s no way to explain that&quot;
	DAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhh
	the reason why I wouldn&apos;t be okay with that
	is beacuse she&apos;d probably be her daughter in the end
	as a human being, I&apos;m insulted
	as to how they handled their character
	like, because she was a woman, she had to come to the completely unscientific conclusion that love is something that science can&apos;t understand
	like, fuck Nolan, man
	I mean
	she did turn out to be right in the end
	love DID in fact turn out to be a transdimensional force
	which kinda ruined the movie for ne
	I wouldn&apos;t say they made her the most rational member of the crew though
	I disagree with you there
	she did sorta cause one crew member to die
	and she was the one to suggest that love was transcendental
	is that so?
	and McConaughey was a world class physicist
	astrophysicist
	absolutely not
	despite all the criticism I have for this movie though
	it was pretty good
	I respect the special effects department
	it&apos;s attention to detail on various scientific elements
	I mean, like, fuck Christopher Nolan, he&apos;s just Michael Bay who scored higher on his SAT
	but overall this was a good movie
	many
	many people liked the avengers
	I wouldn&apos;t even classify it as a movie
	I&apos;d classify it as Marvel Expo 201 
	it&apos;ll be remembered in the same way as Avatar will be remembered
	financially
	I&apos;ts the third highest grossing movie of all time
	noit accounting for inflation
	Joss Whedon said himself he didn[t even try to write for the avengers
	which I respect
	hey man
	everyone has their ups and downs
	yes, he was behind Ali9en Resurrection
	but he alwo wrotye Toyu Story
	certainly
	without John Lassiter, Pixar would be nothing
	but Whedon did contribute quite a bit towards Toy STory
	XD
	and yes
	Steve Jobs
	he contributed
	...cash?
	look, let&apos;s be honest here
	in the 90&apos;s
	Steve Jobs was nothing more than an investor
	what abotu his humanitatian effor...pfffffffttttt
	I cantr even complete that sentence XD
	yep
	so
	there&apos;ve been a couple successful Toy Story shorts
	halloween and I think christmas specials
	I&apos;ve watched them, they&apos;re pretty good
	I&apos;m very, very nervous abotu Toy Story 4 thougj
	mostly becayse TS3 wrapped thinsg up sop perfectly
	since Cars  
	I&apos;m sad to say this
	but I don&apos;t trust Pixar anymore
	they had a good run
	like, a historically good run
	like, rivaling or even surpassing the Disney Renasiiance of the 90&apos;s
	but idk
	gurney, what&apos;ve you been up to as of late?
	we should hang out
	I
	have no idea what that is
	lemme guess
	I&apos;ll guess
	the imperial something somethiing&apos;
	butr better
	so
	no chicken nuggets and awful pizza XD
	like at imperial
	http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnCPMIux1ENByBFqZE8mO1Kd7cSRhBUSLOcL5FIRCydRhFyFYD
	her?
	I looked up LazyTown on wikipedia
	the name Julia Mariello came up
	but lemme look up tanvi
	http://www.matrimonialbank.com/bollywood/starpictures/tanvi-verma-4.jpg
	I can dig it
	she is less than basic
	I&apos;d let her tell me that love transcends dimensions
	I would watch Memento with her
	she;d talk to me about how disjointed nattratives are so nuancedEdited 
	I would nod and smile
	and then the ooga would begin
	I have begun to watch the Simpsons
	25 years too late XD
	I started with teh Treehouses of Horror]
	quality stuff
	just
	don&apos;t go past the year 200 
	that&apos;s when the simpsosns became the zombie simpsons
	also, this picture you linked to me
	I&apos;&apos;ll confess, I&apos;m far too drubk to recognize anyone
	whi si this?
	[5:00:39 AM] Scott Gurney: http://sp7.fotolog.com/photo/23/28/30/julianamauriello/1267115390493_f.jpg&lt;&lt;&lt; 
	wait, ok
	I&apos;ve done my research
	Gurney, I wan&apos;t you to promise me something
	never go into Medway
	it
	it&apos;s  a seedy, unholy place
	I promise you gurney
	I will never go to sharon
	unless the Jewish Illuminati invites me to take part in a timeshare
	man, like
	I guarantee you
	you;&apos;ve never had an entire town cost you a car
	if I get the chance
	I will firebomb the streets of that place
	maybe not the whole town
	but at least a certain culdesac
	Scott
	have you ever
	been made troo kill a lviing creature?
	because I have
	it was the year 200 
	I and several of my cohorts, living in a Medway culdesac at tge time
	werre involved with a regional conflict with a culdesac down th street
	we decided to settle out differences in  a game of
	&quot;Ghhosts in the Graveyard&quot;
	basically tag, but at night
	long story short, someone pushed me tio the ground
	this owuld&apos;ve been ok
	I, along with my cohorts, were used to scuffles sucj as this
	however
	this pushing
	resuiled in a death
	the death of our mascor
	a feral cat
	an albino tabby missing one ear
	we&apos;d been caring for it for 8 months or so
	and my corpulent body killed it
	it&apos;s ok
	a little more than ten years later
	I experienced my first sexual encounter
	with a former ally
	in the culdesac wars
	coincidentally
	and not to my knowledge
	she was dating the very man who pushed me onto said cat
	and now
	I can&apos;t go to medway anymoreEdited 
	I tried to shit on said town
	I really did
	but unlike sutton
	tjere were no Nazis living there
	ir just
	it just dudn;&apos;t work
	my grudge is not against the town
	thoug it&apos;s educational system did indeed suck
	they didn&apos;t even believe in MCAS
	no, when I gather strength
	when I gather appropriate political power
	my target will be those two culdesacs
	man, like
	a silver lining for my dad having a stroke
	like, it&apos;s already been determined that he won&apos;t be able to utilize the left size of hiis body again
	so I&apos;m probably gonna be getting his truck
	and lie, 80%of that is gonna be me transporting him to wherever he wants to go\
	but maybe
	just maybe
	I&apos;ll be able to get to medway
	and rain hell down on my enemies
	I have no idea
	but then again
	I didn&apos;t have a plan that time when my parents betrayed me
	and they had like
	clinicical cases of poison oak
	I trust my imagination
	CNN&apos;s coverage of Ferguson
	all you hear in the background for 2 solid minutes &quot;FUCK THE POLICE! FUCK THE POLICE!&quot;
	so good
	there was that one time
	wait, nevermind, everyone died
	have you seen the john oliver sketch about that town in New Hampshire that got a fully armored assault vehicle?Edited 
	when applying for said vehicle, they cited the need to combat terrorism
	and a specific example
	was that their annual pumpkin festival was a prime target for such an attackEdited 
	you don&apos;t wanna say Allah Akbar
	you won&apos;t get taken in the rapture
	not even all christians
	just the super devout
	and of course
	you can&apos;t be a midget
	that shit don&apos;t fly with JC
	speaking of which
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfQDU3Lphrs
	I&apos;ve consulted three people about this movie
	none of them got further than 10 minutes
	looks like it
	my favorite shiny might be Metagross
	it&apos;s the George Lucas of pokemon
	wait
	wait
	I meant lopez
	so long as it&apos;s not devolving into reviews of Mein Kamf
	I think you&apos;ll be ok
	you could delete your post
	and unite them in their hatred
	of you
	Franky, reading the comments right now, it&apos;s not too bad
	mainly just &quot;look at the documents they released&quot; vs &quot;here&apos;s my experiences with police brutality&quot;
	pretty standard stuff
	yeah, last message was an hour ago
	^
	Patrick, why did you have to go and bring up the rwandan genocide?
	too soon, man
	Trayvon Cosby gave ebola to John Star Wars and was aquitted of all charges
	also, beautiful
	you know, somewhere in a west hollywood studio apartment, Steven Collins is watching coverage of Ferguson and Bill Cosby and sighing in relief
	November 26th, 2014
	that is
	the saddest thing I&apos;ve ever heard
	the voice actor or the character himself?
	Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

	and also, very good will, how bout yours? 
	I&apos;d be down for Saturday shits and giggles 
	I have a friend named Erica
	she is displeased with her situation in life
	think about it...
	of course
	I on the other hand love life
	it&apos;s not like I AM ERICA or something
	and there you go
	I am legally dead
	seeya then!
	miss you too, Jay

	December 2nd, 2014
	very good 
	you really captured the &quot;Bambi&apos;s dead mom&quot; aesthetic 
	nothing like a little end of the world ass-to-mouth to start your day
	you&apos;d probably face some institutional pressure to act in a certain way, though
	like, you might have to openly condemn homosexuality and condoms
	now, here&apos;s a question
	like, the day after you die, would you leave behind a document that explains everything you said was bullshit?
	or would you let the bullshit continue on after death?
	honetly, I think he&apos;s just a lizard man who kinda sounds like Alan Rickman, who woke up one day and realized &quot;oh hey, I have a worldwide harem now!&quot;
	the day TMZ discovers his vestigial tail
	I dunno
	yeah, that&apos;s another possibility
	every third week in december they must both fast and marathon Sherlock
	I really don&apos;t want him in Star Wars, though
	like
	I REALLY, REALLY don&apos;t want him in Star Wars
	the Jjabrams is doing an ok job so far
	he can&apos;t fuck it up now
	do you have any idea
	like, a literal army of teenage girls would be at our doorstep
	led by Stephen Moffat
	no, here&apos;s what we do
	we use your connections with the illuminati, right?
	and we go in and alter the footage of everything Cumberbatch has been in
	and we replace him with Gilbert Gottfried
	we would reverse the polarity, as it were
	And lo, the mighty Cumberpit will open, sucking in all those who dared pledge faith to it

	Who dares disturb my slumber?
	That&apos;s my favorite moment in South Park
	the one where Cartman thinks he&apos;s psychic
	the detectives show up at the real killer&apos;s house
	&quot;Sorry to disturb you, Mr....?&quot;
	&quot;God&quot;
	im all for that
	whats night train
	we could probably hang out with bridge people
	you know, people who hang out under bridges
	oh, they have more than apples under the bridge
	actually, that&apos;s not true, they uhh
	they have less than apples
	in fact, most of them dont really know what fruit is
	those are two very different bridge stories XD
	I mean
	KK, what exactly was your relationship with said rats?
	nice, you know what kind of wine?
	also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TnFIDKyX5 
	I like to think it&apos;s called reichschlagger
	I don&apos;t know why
	lololol
	let&apos;s just break into a chuck-e-cheese
	defile the animatronics, defecate in the ball pits
	have a grand old american time
	naturally
	this is a family establishment, we need to maintain our standards
	ignore your tastebuds
	that is your irish gift/curse
	we sacrifice taste for efficiency
	we dont have to pretend
	becuase everything IS potatoes
	we must consult the Yumbo
	&quot;And here&apos;s *hic* another thing abotu the world bank that I bet you didnt know we knew!&quot;
	cool!
	I actually need to give him back his batteriesEdited 
	pretty sure there aren&apos;t any others in his house
	mkay, I&apos;m gonna take a quick shower
	kk, I told you to keep a tight lid on that nerve gas
	not sure if my mom&apos;s gonna be comfortable with me driving her car
	but I&apos;ll ask
	welp, thats a hardline nope
	yessir
	YESSIR
	Have you the Talismans of Sight, Mind and Prosperity, puny mortal?
	I&apos;m down for whenever
	found a collection of bad horror movies one one DVD
	among the titles: The Vampire Conspiracy, Fist of the Vampire, and Bachelor Party in the Bungalo of the Damned
	AND TWO KINDS OF SUNNY D!
	I&apos;d join you on that XD
	I&apos;ve been drunk during the day at KK&apos;s house before
	so you do. know. the movie!
	*children
	yes, very good
	any word from Gurney?
	so last light, I got really drunk and changed everyone&apos;s name on my skype to yumbo
	this is very confusing
	you say that
	well KK, I can usually recognize when you talk because your text looks like that of a stroke victims
	everyone elses however, little more difficult to discern
	in any case, I&apos;ll likely need a ride as there are no cars in my driveway
	ahh yes, nothing to brighten your day quite like the Tuskegee Experiment
	Huh, I
	really didn&apos;t need to read that
	not because of it&apos;s grotesqueness, mind you
	but the title Grease Gun Injury
	really needs no further elaboration
	3) how will it help Burger King cope with the inevitavle financial trainwreck that is the Yumbo Sandwich
	ok, so, plan time
	KK, how psyched would your parents be if they came home to a bunch of drunk people watching ahh let&apos;s see
	I am Omega
	oh, is this just a ripoff of I am Legend?
	noiiiiice
	your internet is not Omega
	NOPE
	*about the struggles of Christian Slater&apos;s spastic colon
	sounds reasonable
	4:59, get a 401k you lush!
	5:00, a-ok!
	I mean
	I don&apos;t think public intoxication is technically a crime in Mass
	just by itself?
	that you know nothing?
	anywhere&apos;s fine for me
	I&apos;m totes up for flipping a coin
	to be fair, it is getting kinda dark out
	iunno, KK, how&apos;s about you find a random number generator on the interwebs
	so far we have KK&apos;s house, Franky&apos;s house, and other/outside
	lol very well
	in either case we&apos;ll be sure to keep it down guys
	would your mom be ok with leaving your/now her room?
	and of course to watch I Am Omega
	yeah I&apos;m good whenever
	you&apos;re ginger scott bakulaEdited

	don&apos;t worry, Yumbo
	it was just the slightly racist thought of a friend posing as me
	he claims that Patrick Swayze underwent pigmentation surgery
	and now goes by the stage name Sway Z
	that the thing True Detective shamelessly ripped off?
	very obscure fact about jars of moles
	they are the primary ingredient in the yumbo sandwich
	yessir, yessir
	you don&apos;t know how to spell cabal, do you?

	Innocentmania X
	the rumble in the crumbling junkyard
	Ric Flair vs The Grim Reaper for the World Heavyweight Championship
	listen, I&apos;m gonna take a hardline stance on the sumerians
	so, their language existed in a functional capacity for like 3000 years
	the fact that their language to this day is not entirely decipherable
	perhaps, maybe, they didn&apos;t have a lot to say
	that&apos;s right, folks, fuck the sumerians!
	I mean, like, half of that is our love affair of the American Bald Eagle, specifically
	...you&apos;re doing that thing South Park did this past season, aren&apos;t you?

	this is the reason why Pokemon will live forever
	they need to cater to competitive players
	in 100 years, there will be a good variety
	strategy doesn&apos;t really matter when you have salamence or higher
	I mean, Ice is a pretty awesome offensive type
	is Knock-Off dark?
	I&apos;m more familiar with Gen III, in that one I think it was normal
	oh nevermind it was always dark
	you do you, man
	hmm, well
	it&apos;s average Sp. Attack stat is only like 6 
	I could see how that might be a problem
	I love tickle
	whenever I have a whiscash, I always keep tickle
	...upon mentioning that &quot;I love tickle&quot;, I realize I must now seek like 5 slim jims to regain my manhood
	I love whiscash
	so derpy
	plus, water/ground typing is the best ever
	ask Swampert mofo
	you thinking of Lanturn?
	I love lantrun
	it has volt absorb, not lightningrod
	I will eventually
	I&apos;m not too familiar with the specific methods of professional pokemon battles
	but I&apos;d learn quickly
	I know what sweepers and walls are, and some other terms as well
	so, you wanna know something funny?
	you know how I stole some weed from my bro?
	well, I was kinda drunk at the time, and
	I can&apos;t remember where I hid it
	it might be somewhere in my kitchen, but that might have been a dream
	I&apos;m doing that right now
	its not helping
	but MST3K is that much funnier
	I hear in this newest one, Smaug dies and is reincarnated as Dr. Strange

	Gurney, please 
	it&apos;s only noon 
	oh shit, I&apos;ve seen this one 
	in what context I saw this, I do not remember 
	maybe 
	but I mostly just listened to Power Glove that day 
	no, Yumbo, you&apos;re falling into the gurneytrap 
	you must have the proper suit

	oh, man, I&apos;ve just had a startling realization 
	the number one rule of &quot;don&apos;t go below the mason-dixon line&quot; 
	that applies globally 
	stay the fuck away from Australia 
	like, the further south you go beyond that point, things just get more horrible

	see scott, you&apos;re problem is
	you don&apos;t run alot
	you would be literally as much a ninja as the guy from Die Antwoord

	speaking of which, all of his videos, except I think for that last one, are still up

	I&apos;m still not totally convinced that this isn&apos;t some huge underground promotion for a found-footage reboot of American Psycho 
	oh no!
	you all right?
	so what&apos;s the damage to your vehicle?
	was there any structrual damage?
	like, is the frame of the car ok?
	New England was not meant to be a place where people live
	lol
	there are pirates in somalia who praise on a daily basis &quot;at least I don&apos;t live in Mississippi!&quot;
	I might have a meeting with this cult I joined a while back that monday
	I&apos;ll see if I can get out of it, but Jeremiah is pretty strict
	you say that
	I saw him resurrect the ghost of Stonewall Jackson
	he told me a mint julip will be waiting for me on the other side
	not Jeremiah, but the ghost

	goddamn Making of a Prophet is a terrible game
	yes
	my eyeballs were beaten out of me by a deciple of muhammad
	so my directional keys are reversed
	his name is Tom Cruise Christ
	there&apos;s a puddle of water that he worships, and it&apos;s name is L. Ron Puddle
	also, there are buildings with vents and posters, in barely A.D. times
	What have I said about making Bernie Mac one of your idols?
	it never works out

	I&apos;m having a weird day 
	I&apos;ve been watching White House Coorespondence Dinners shows from the 90&apos;s 
	how bout you? 
	I bought Fireball from the Mendon Wine and Spirits recently 
	and the guy who sold it to me said it&apos;s not healthy 
	like, his explanation was that Europe banned Fireball and other Dr. McGillicuddy produckts 
	becaus ethey contained chemicals found in yoga mats or something 
	I agree 
	In the past 4 hours I&apos;ve had abput a liter of Fireball 
	perhaps I will transform into a yoga mat myself 
	and then Russell Braqnd will meditate on me 
	listen, like, life is fleeting

	This has been your weekly Abe Vigoda update. Goodnight
	You&apos;re welcomeEdited 
	This Monday at 11: is Gene Wilder still kicking it?
	I half-expected a dick shaped hadoken to be edited in
	one day, KK will code the image of an 11&quot; penis into every piece of software in the world
	a 40 of crack is in all our futures
	is he eating a fucking McRib?
	you know, this all looks suspiciously like Peter Gabriel&apos;s music videos when he started using cgi
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt87bLX7m_o
	it worked for Steve Martin, it can work for you
	you need to find a treestump first, though
	can&apos;t play banjo without sitting on a treestump
	also, if you&apos;re gonna play, be on the lookout for jackolopes
	jackolopes flock to the sound of banjos like moths to a semi-rapey flame
	I found out in 2009 that the narwhal was real
	so I take it you&apos;re becoming southern as fuck then?
	just be sure to manage it well
	or you will end up like kid rock
	money has nothing to do with being white trash
	of course he does, he was born free
	were they one of the ones that survived?
	because that is a fate worse than death
	I get it.
	this from your friend the gouger?
	What is a so-called &quot;secondary world&quot;? A way of imagining the impossible? A way of communicating dreams? Or perhaps a type of &quot;roman expérimental&quot;: a proper investigation of history, society and science within a generated testing ground of the mind. KMCM stands for a multi-disciplinary collaboration between dreamers to develop a fictional world in which scientific concepts, social interactions, historical events, and more importantly polemics of all kinds, can be analysed and &quot;let grow,&quot; as one might expect from characters within a &quot;roman expérimental.&quot;
	what the actual fuck
	well specifically, it&apos;s a shitty knife that will break after two or three uses
	I like to think his latest employer drove up to whatever isolated cabin he was staying at, and like, pulled up just as he was chopping wood
	offered him a job, he tells them &quot;I gave up that life...&quot;
	I am interested in science and its practice. Biology is tightly linked to history: evolution itself is meaningless without a time variable. The corpus of scientific literature depends on prior experiments and theories. Understanding this relationship is not only intellectually stimulating and philosophically valid; it can also help give meaning to the science and caution against errors in progress.Okay, here&apos;s what sorta irks me out of everything else. This is the first item listed under the title &quot;resume&quot;
	and all it is is him saying &quot;we discovered things in the past, we continue to discover things.&quot;
	like, there&apos;s nothing deep behind that, he just sounds like a french asshole
	oh allright, that makes slightly more sense
	I suppose I&apos;m the french asshole
	I&apos;m just too tired for any of this
	I walked like 5 miles today, why did I come home to this?
	I had debts
	they were forgiven
	I basically took two separate trips to a liquor store due to indecisive parties
	but you know, Gurney, looking at this highly detailed rendering of the western world, as told by Gustave, I can sort of relate to his interest in the history of logic
	like, I&apos;m looking at this shit, right, and I&apos;m wondering
	how far back in gustave&apos;s life would I have to travel to find a sane person?
	And then there&apos;s Franky, who wants a fucking banjo
	which is fine, it&apos;s a cool instrument
	it&apos;s just obscure
	It&apos;s like going to an ice cream parlor and asking for passionfruit flavor
	it would probably be good
	THAT is a flavor of ice cream I&apos;m just now realizing I see nowhere
	wow, that makes no sense!
	yeah, you can&apos;t really sell something like that unless it the connotation of being a challenging, &quot;manly&quot; thing to eat
	damnit, I&apos;m gonna be researching peppermint and all related species for like 10 hours
	thanks, fuckers

	dress shirts are for plebians
	if you don&apos;t have the cahones to interview for a job wearing nothing but a speedo, you don&apos;t deserve said job
	did you know that in 1997, when Steve Jobs was trying to get back into Apple, he interviewed in his birthday suit?
	I suppose Ashton Kutcher doesn&apos;t get your goat then
	otherwise, you would&apos;ve noticed if he&apos;d been butt naked
	I haven&apos;t seen it yet, but I do assume the worst
	there&apos;s supposed to be another movie about him starring Michael Fassbender
	I&apos;m happy about that
	I can only hope that Bill Gates was played by Red Foreman
	and that he called him a dumbass the entire time
	wasn&apos;t a great father, if anything
	like, due to the whole found footage horror genre that&apos;s in vogue right now
	I can&apos;t really be disturbed by this
	even though I know this is totally real
	oh man, the look on that worker&apos;s face
	so, there&apos;s this dude, right
	who&apos;s at mcdonalds, who orders a happymeal with My Little Pony toys
	he promptly interviews someone who works there about the nuances of My Little Pony
	her reaction is one of horror and disgust
	no
	he&apos;s
	he&apos;s voicing the ponies
	this is one of the reasons why I&apos;ve rejected society as a concept
	like, I really can&apos;t wait till I die
	this is the universe that we live in?
	fuck that shit, I&apos;m moving to valhalla
	or at least I&apos;m getting a timeshare 
	may the planets allign when MLP is cancelled and forgotten 
	but seriously, like, who wants to do a whole Heaven&apos;s Gate thing? 
	I have plenty of sneakers 
	cool! 
	there&apos;s a comet coming in like 18 months

	there&apos;s this sweet old couple named Marshall and Bonnie 
	they&apos;re a little eccentric, but they have a lot of friends 
	and they&apos;re really into astronomy 
	you&apos;d like them 
	they had a pretty cool GeoCities website back in the day 
	it was a little contoversial, but than again what isn&apos;t these days? 
	hey, you like Kool-Aid, right? 
	just checking 
	ehh, it;s not that tasty 
	it&apos;s one of those things where you have to have it once, and then you never drink it again 
	yes

	oh man, when the audio on the Jim Jones tape becomes distorted, it honestly sounds like the devil himself 
	do you not think I&apos;ve allready made this my homepage? 
	which album, Gurney? 
	oh, $200 
	Sleep. Dream. Wake Up. is my favorite 
	because there&apos;s no way that track will help you get to sleep 
	it&apos;s horrifying 
	it&apos;s official: Old Jeff Bridges is better than slightly past middle-aged Jeff Bridges 
	granny 
	It&apos;s a widely known fact that supporters of red delicious apples also supported the Tuskegee Experiments 
	my point exactly 
	Several studies done by Swedish scientists have found that affinity for golden delicious apples leads not only to pedophilia but also to breast cancer 
	the same goes for red delicious, though the affects on pedophilia rates are much more aggressive 
	and of those places, how many prefer red/golden delicious to granny smith? 
	because I&apos;m willing to bet it&apos;s ALL of them 
	you would be thouroughly suprisedEdited  
	Cesar Chaves first noticed the correlationEdited  
	no, he was the fruit guy 
	he teamed up with Simon Weisen...child and brought down various pedophilia markets across the world 
	and yet there&apos;s still work to be done 
	which is why red delicious apples must be banned across NAFTA markets 
	red deltenuous, you mean 
	nope 
	once you get that apple in ya, all you crave is that 9 year old dick 
	I WAND THAT CHISEN DICK 
	I would check your boyfriend&apos;s birth certificate Cristiana 
	because he is totally in elementary school 
	I don&apos;t think I have 
	but I know many people named dennis 
	and none of them are above the age of 12 
	dennis is a young name 
	look, it&apos;s like that snickers commercial 
	Cristiana, eat a granny smith 
	you become a pedophile when you&apos;re hungry 
	hey, if I were a pedophile I&apos;d look to be proud for anything else 
	actually, that is quite impressive 
	the snicker is quite a cumbersome candybar 
	Screw it. I&apos;ve gotten gum stuck in my beard for the last time. Goodbye literally all body hair.

	A Steve Guttenberg Classic, 8.5/10 recommended
	even more so than Cocoon
	you, of literally all people, know I mean actor, and star of 3 out of 6 Police Academy movies, Steve Guttenberg
	if you know of a projectionist Michael Winslow, I&apos;d be highly interested
	ehh, I&apos;d assume some successful people saracstically refer to their less glamorous past professions as an attempt to endear themselves to others
	does CNET still exist?
	I assumed it was the RadioShack of whatever the hell it tried to be
	apparently CBS owns it
	lol
	CBS is, sadly, has been the most popular big 3 channel for 7 years or so
	due to NCIS, Two and a Half Men and, to severe consternation, The Big Bang Theory
	I&apos;m not too worried
	like, you know how print media is on the way out as of late?
	the next thing to go is network television
	I&apos;m sure you know this\
	Iunno, like, the prospect of internet-based services such as Netflix and Hulu
	precisely
	I accept The Big Bang Theory for what it is
	but what it is is old people trying to identify with their children
	it is offensive, yes, but what do you expect?
	I&apos;m willing to bet that most people who watch the BBT were alive to watch Nixon resign as President
	Chuck Lorre I believe is the main guy behind it
	he is also behind Two and a Half Men
	he&apos;s basically the devil
	removed from context, that sounds like the quintessential antisemetic comment
	I&apos;m going to make a prediction right here
	this person is Daniel Day-Lewis
	and this is all a viral marketing campaign for his newest film
	is this your Bobby Dias, Gurney?
	http://bobbydias.com/
	oh shit, he spends the whole video focused on his mouth and beard
	Bobby Dias is an enigma, wrapped in a riddle, trapped in a russian multi-doll
	that&apos;s not the correct term, russian multi-doll
	but I assume you know what I mean by that
	yes that, thank you for justifying my mental lapse
	so, Bobby Dias is an elderly gentleman
	who claims relationships with various presidents, mostly Ronald Reagan
	he is evidently a vietnam war veteran
	and also a grand architect
	he claims he designed various buildings and dams when he was 9 years old

	so, here&apos;s the thing that makes me doubt that this person is a troll
	so, ignoring his supposed relationships with various presidents and movie stars, he makes a big stink about his other job of planting trees
	I found his facebook, and on it, there are pictures of hundreds, perhaps thousands of trees that he supposedly planted
	https://www.facebook.com/bobby.dias.77/photos
	feel free to peruse his madness
	wait, I apologize, that is simply a cover for his actual fb page

	Your weekly joke (relevant to the early 1990&apos;s): Woody Allen, recently divorced from his wife Mia Farrow, is continuing to pursue a romantic relationship with his former adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn; in related news, Mr. Allen is set to produce what&apos;s being called as the most faithful film adaptation of the novel &quot;Lolita&quot;Edited 
	I apologize
	I said film twice in that, I meant to say novel
	Also, Abe Vigota is totes still kicking it, in case anyone is interested
	You know, I wonder how Bill Cosby&apos;s career would be doing right now if, like with Woody Allen, Louis CK and Co. were supporting him

	don&apos;t forget the cross-burnings! It ain&apos;t a party without cross-burnings!
	Jay, I&apos;m so sorry
	you should shock it 
	nostalgia typically cycles every 20 years 
	there was VH1&apos;s &quot;remember all the 80&apos;s cocaine&quot; type shows 
	it&apos;s good 
	main problem is it shouldn&apos;t be an hour long 
	so the actual battlebotting is only like a third of the show, the rest is generic melodrama you find on network reality shows 
	I know, it&apos;s so sad 
	but it&apos;s pretty hype nonetheless 
	yeah, that&apos;s your best bet, they&apos;re only like 5 minutes a piece 
	ahh, those might just be previous seasons of BB 
	it aired from 2000-02 
	I recommend Razorback vs. Icewave, that was a pretty good match 
	I&apos;m really rooting for that one 
	only bot in the competition using an internal combustion engine 
	nightmare is a legend, but the fact that it hasn&apos;t implemented some sort of self-righting mechanism in like 15 years is embarrasingEdited  
	fuck wedges so hard 
	it&apos;s the same reason why Warhead lost 
	it just undermines everything that makes metal death machines punching eachother to death so fun to watch 
	ahh, complete control vs ghost raptor? 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrG0PfRL0w 
	it&apos;s whatever, abc has to appeal to certain demographics so BattleBots isn&apos;t a sausagefest ratings-wise 
	I am glad Warhead got a wildcard spot, though 
	give Team Razer another shot at the gold 
	yeah that&apos;s another controvery 
	yeah, I guess it&apos;s keeping with the spirit of smashing shit into other shit 
	I think the rule is the total weight of what you put in has to be under a certain threshold, not necessarily just one bot 
	still, it&apos;s close enough to cheating 
	there&apos;s no way that wasn&apos;t a stunt put up by abc 
	counter revolution got wreeeecked 
	probably one of the heavier ones, should be tough to beat 
	there used to be, I don&apos;t think so for this season 
	yeah, I suppose 
	it could just force everyone to build heavy shit 
	yeah there is, I think it&apos;s like 100lbs or something 
	oh wait, I might be full of shit, the actual limit might be 250 
	http://www.tvinsider.com/article/2249/battlebots-returns-for-more-epic-robot-destruction/
	THEN: The playing field was divided between lightweights, middleweights, heavyweights and super-heavyweights. “It was sort of a hodge-podge of robot combat,” Munson says.NOW: Everyone’s in the same weight class—but that doesn’t mean each robot weighs the same amount. “Some of the robots have multi-bots, which means that all of their robots are under [the] 250-pound [maximum],” Roski explains. “So they might have two or three smaller robots and one big robot that weighs around 200 pounds.”

	October 14th, 2015
	yeah, she probably did the best I&apos;d say 
	although I wouldn&apos;t call it a debate really 
	basically just questions meant to cause candidates to confront eachother &quot;reality show style&quot; 
	like: &quot;Jim Webb, you are a veteran of the Vietnam War. Bernie Sanders applied for conscientious objector status. Tell him why that disqualifies him from the presidency and also why he smells funny.&quot; 
	no, it&apos;s fine, &apos;cause the pundits, they know 
	they know better than we do 
	that&apos;s true, he did probably cause her to focus more on income inequality, raising the minimum wage etc. 
	and her stance on the Trans Pacific Partnership as well 
	although who knows how long she stays to the left once she gets the nomination 
	no, but, she can evolve though 
	she doesn&apos;t break promises, she evolves on the issues 
	she&apos;s an animorph 
	it could be she&apos;s a fifth dimensional being 
	able to see all possible outcomes at once 
	before her vote for the iraq war, her stance on the issue behaved both like a particle and a wave 
	that&apos;d be nice 
	with vice presidents Kanye West and Glenn Beck? 
	Manny Pacquiao might as well run 
	he is a congressman in the phillipines actually 
	but I really don&apos;t know, Trump&apos;s like 
	you can&apos;t tell how much of it is people not giving a shit 13 months before the election 
	and how many are serious about him 
	I&apos;ll say this though, he&apos;s getting all the free publicity 
	if he does win, CNN&apos;s to blame 
	so where will you be moving if Trump is elected?

	oh! I just remembered, the most fucked up thing about the debate 
	okay, so 
	one of the talking points was the rising costs of medicine and people making exorbitant profits off of shit 
	so, the debate was sponsored in part by a drug company advertising Kerydin, which is supposed to treat toenail fungus

	it&apos;s true. If he hadn&apos;t published his 100k page manifesto or made those videos, he would just be some unremarkable sociopath that went on a shooting spree

	no it was not XD. But yeah, I&apos;ll probably be back in about a year or so and we&apos;ll chill and watch bad movies
	also, we still have to write Bats: the Musical together XD
	I typed DIna Meyer into google, the first item to come up was &quot;Dina Meyer Now&quot;
	that can&apos;t be good XD
	nope
	so he&apos;s like the black Randy Quaid?
	I think I remember this song
	I think it was in Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater  
	I mean, that&apos;s not the worst thing that can happen to a rapper
	you can take PCP and eat a girl&apos;s lung
	XD yes
	infooooorma!
	insomblabablablablablam

	XD that&apos;s how my neighbors died 15 years ago
	I had this really shitty babysitter that lived nextdoor that tried to give me an earpiercing
	and she was kinda satan, but then we moved away from that area, and then a year later her parents drowned in a hot tub
	she didn&apos;t do a good job
	didn&apos;t go all the way through
	I still have a lump on my ear
	you should have been my babysitter
	apparently Harrison Ford knows how to pierce ears
	I would&apos;ve been a real quiet baby
	like, dead quiet
	...that sounds like a prequel to a Steven Seagal movie
	where he&apos;s a baby but also an assassin
	Steven Seagal is... Dead Quiet
	that is the perfect description
	you just throw pokeballs at Steven Seagal and he gets irritated
	and then Joe Arpio comes over and yells at you
	Joe Arpio will mistake him for a latino
	throw him into mexico
	hey, man, I&apos;m gonna pass out

	how do you classify shitty nerds?
	like not nerds that think they are nerds? or people who know of nerd culture who try to appropriate that sort of thing for marketing purposes
	you&apos;re less than a shitlord gurney

	I got eaten by so many bears and wolves
	I&apos;m their bitch until something changes
	skaggs told me it was like minecraft...
	you don&apos;t get beaten to death with a rock by a 12 year old in minecraft
	also why the koreans
	there are a disproportionate amount of koreans in rust
	I think we&apos;re on Seattle something
